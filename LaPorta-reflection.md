*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
*This GPS solidified using GitHub to create a new repository and also pushing my branches up to the master in GitHub, which was something I struggled with beforehand.
*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
*Many features of GitHub were clarified, especially features involving using comments and the unified/split feature to look at your code. This seems helpful for future use when reviewing the code of other developers while working on a team.
*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
*I did not have a pair for this session so my guide was my pair/guide hybrid. I acted as the driver so I definitely asked some clarifying questions about the directions she gave for the module. I also got stuck a few times navigating GitHub so I asked questions then as well.
*What still confuses you about Git?
*I would like to continue working on the push/pull features because I find that sometimes when I push something up to GitHub, I don't see a pull request created. I can always created a new pull request to eventually merge the code but I'd like to figure that out. I can also work on navigating GitHub a little more easily.
*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
*It was good. My guide was able to make it work and guide me even though my pair did not attend the GPS. I look forward to the next GPS where I will hopefully have a pair.
